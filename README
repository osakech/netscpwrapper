puppeteerssh.pl

I wrote this tool when I needed to connect to multiple ssh servers (>50) and had to execute a rather complicated script which didn' fit in a one liner.

Sytem Requirments
* I used Perl 5.22 during development
* SSH client 

Perl modules:
* Net::OpenSSH;
* Parallel::ForkManager
* File::Slurper
* Getopt::Long::Descriptive

Debian package names:
* libfile-slurper-perl - Perl SSH client package implemented on top of OpenSSH
* libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl - module that handles command-line arguments with usage text
* libparallel-forkmanager-perl - simple parallel processing fork manager for Perl
* libnet-openssh-perl - Perl SSH client package implemented on top of OpenSSH

Install the dependencies by pasting the following line to your console on debian systems:
apt-get install libfile-slurper-perl libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl libparallel-forkmanager-perl libnet-openssh-perl
